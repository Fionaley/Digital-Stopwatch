# Digital-Stopwatch
A high-precision digital stopwatch with an analog dial, built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application combines a traditional stopwatch interface with modern animation and accurate time measurement.  This project demonstrates time-based animation, performance timing, and responsive UI design without external libraries.
